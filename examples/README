HNOCS Simulation Framework for OMNEST/OMNeT++
==============================================

The HNOCS framework is an open-source network-on-chip networks simulation
package, written for the OMNEST/OMNeT++ simulation system. The HNOCS 
framework contains models for several architectures of network on chip 
implementation.

The set of example runs provided by this demo is:

Mesh 4x4
  Async - an asynchronous router design - simplest model assuming no latency
          within the router and no clock that synchronizes the circuit.
  Sync  - a synchronous router with single FIFO per VC on the input buffer
  

Mesh 8x8
  Async - an asynchronous router design - simplest model assuming ...
  Sync  - a synchronous router with single FIFO per VC on the input buffer
  
  
An experiment named unifor_eval - available under each one of the router types -
may be used to produce latency and throughput versus offered load plots.
