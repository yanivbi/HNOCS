HNOCS Simulation Framework for OMNEST/OMNeT++
==============================================

The HNOCS framework is an open-source network-on-chip networks simulation
package, written for the OMNEST/OMNeT++ simulation system. The HNOCS framework
contains models for several architectures of network on chip implementation.
Its main difference from other NoC simulation platforms is that it support
heretogeneous NoC implementations.

Visit our website (http://hnocs.eew.technion.ac.il/) for latest release, forum, and mailiing list. 
Look into the NEWS file to find out about new features added.

GETTING STARTED
---------------
If you read this file you must have downloaded and unzip/untar'ed the HNOCS 
package. To prepare the models you will just need to make sure you have
installed OMNEST/OMNeT++ include <omnet-home-dir>/bin in your PATH and run:
make makefiles
make

It is advisible to take the OMNeT++ tutorial from:  
http://www.omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp40/tictoc-tutorial/index.html.

Then you can gather initial experience by running some of the simulations in
the examples directory by running:
./examples/run_nocs

After that, you can learn the NED language from the OMNeT++ manual & sample
simulations, read the OMNeT++ user manual and start coding your own modules. 

Directory structure
-------------------
The directories included in this model are following the basic structure of a NoC:
src/                   all modules of the projects 
   cores/              the netork interfaces
      sources/         packet generators injecting into the network
      sinks/           packet collectors 
      
   topologies/         collection of common topologies
   
   routers/            the packet switching logic within the network
      flat/            routers that are built with no internal hierarchy
      hier/            hierarchical routers built from a set of "ports"
         sched/        schedulers=arbiters responsible for selecting which
                       packet will win the out port
            wormhole/  schedulers that are enforcing wormhole packet switching
         inPort/       input port logic including the queues and request for
                       arbitration 
         opCalc/       output port claculators - the routing function - 
                       selecting packet out port
            static/    deterministic = static routing 
         vcCalc/       VC allocators
            free/      VC allocators that are allocating from the set of free
                       VCs

Using NED Interfaces
=====================
To facilitate a flexible simulation environment we use the OMNeT++ "Module
Interface"feature. This allows us to declare the exect implementation to be
used for each of the modules as a paremeter during simulation. Each interface
is included in its own NED file.

The following interfaces are defined:
NI_Ifc       - Network interface; ports: in, out; params: id (its address)
Source_Ifc   - Source of traffic; ports: out; params: srcId
Sink_Ifc     - Sink of traffic; ports: in; params: numVCs 
Port_Ifc     - Hierarchical router port; ports: in, out, sw_in, sw_out, 
               sw_ctrl_in, sw_ctrl_out; params: numPorts
Router_Ifc   - NoC router; ports in[], out[]; params: id, numPorts 
Sched_Ifc    - Scheduler/Arbiter; ports: ctrl[], in[], out[]; params: numVCs
InPort_Ifc   - Router input port; ports: in, out[], ctrl[], calcVC, calcOp; 
               params: numVCs 
OPCalc_Ifc   - Routing calculation; ports: calc
VCCalc_Ifc   - VC Allocator; ports: calc
